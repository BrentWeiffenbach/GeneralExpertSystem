BrightWave Inc. – Quality Assurance Plan (Mobile App “WaveTracker”)
Version: QA-Plan v0.9
Date: 2025-11-30
Audience: QA Team, Developers, Product Owners, Project Manager

1. Introduction & Purpose

The purpose of this Quality Assurance (QA) Plan is to define the testing strategy, scope, responsibilities, deliverables, and metrics for validating the mobile application “WaveTracker.” This ensures the application meets functional, reliability, performance, and user-experience standards before release to production.

2. Scope

This QA Plan covers:

Functional testing of all user-facing features (user registration/login, data entry, data sync, offline/online behavior).

Integration testing (backend API, authentication, data storage, synchronization).

UI/UX testing (on supported devices, screen sizes, orientation).

Performance testing (app launch time, data sync speed, memory / resource usage, battery consumption).

Regression testing (after each new release / bug fix).

User acceptance testing (UAT) before major release.

Out-of-scope: Load/stress testing at scale (handled by a separate performance engineering team), security penetration testing (handled by security audit team), and localization/internationalization (planned for future version).

3. Roles & Responsibilities

QA Lead: overall QA process ownership, test plan maintenance, reporting to Product Manager.

QA Engineers: design and execute test cases, log defects, retest fixes, regression cycles.

Developers: provide build, fix defects, support debugging, provide patch versions.

Product Owner (PO): define acceptance criteria, review UAT results, approve release.

Project Manager: schedule QA cycles, ensure resources (devices, test data) are available, coordinate release.

4. Testing Strategy & Approach

Use a combination of manual testing (functional, UI/UX, exploratory) and automated testing (regression, integration) where feasible.

Maintain a test suite with unit tests, integration tests, UI tests (on key user flows), and regression scripts.

Perform smoke test after every build to catch immediate show-stopping issues.

Before each release: full regression + UI/UX + integration tests + performance checks on representative devices.

Use a dedicated test environment (staging) with mirror of production backend, and anonymized test data.

5. Test Planning & Schedule
Phase	Activities	Deliverables	Responsibility
Build 1	Smoke test, basic functional test	Smoke test report	QA Engineer
Build 2	Full functional + integration test	Functional test report, defect log	QA Engineers
Pre-Release	Regression + UI/UX + performance test	Regression report, performance metrics	QA Team
UAT	PO-led user acceptance cycles	UAT report, sign-off	Product Owner + QA Lead
Release	Final verification, build packaging	Release readiness report	QA Lead + PM
6. Defect Reporting & Tracking

All defects logged in bug-tracking system. Each defect must include: description, steps to reproduce, device/OS version, severity, expected result, actual result, screenshots/logs.

Defects are triaged daily: assigned severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and responsible party (dev / QA).

Retesting after fix, and verification of regression safety.

Defect status workflow: New → Confirmed → In progress → Fixed → Retest → Closed or Reopened.

7. Quality Metrics & Exit Criteria

Key Metrics:

Pass rate for test cases (target ≥ 95% for release)

Number of open critical/high defects at freeze (target 0 critical, ≤ 2 high)

Time to fix critical defects (target ≤ 48 hours)

Regression pass rate after bug fixes (target 100%)

Exit Criteria (for release):

All critical defects fixed and closed.

≥ 95% of test cases passed.

No open high-severity defects unless accepted by Product Owner with documented risk.

Key performance benchmarks met (launch time, memory usage, battery use within acceptable bounds).

UAT approval obtained from Product Owner.

8. Risk Management & Contingency Plan

Risks:

Last-minute bug discovery causing release delay.

Incomplete test coverage due to tight timeline or missing devices.

Build instability or environment mismatch between staging and production.

Mitigations:

Maintain release buffer time (1 week) for unplanned bug fixes.

Use device cloud services/emulators when physical devices unavailable.

Use automated smoke tests on every build to catch early regressions.

Maintain clear communication and triage meeting daily during testing window.

9. Documentation & Reporting

Generate test reports after each test phase: include summary statistics, passed/failed counts, defect logs, performance metrics, and notes.

QA Lead prepares “Release Readiness Report” combining test results, risk assessments, and final recommendation.

All documentation stored in version-controlled repository (e.g., shared drive, Confluence, Git).

After release, maintain a post-release defect log (monitor for any new bug reports, customer feedback).

10. Review & Plan Updates

The QA Plan must be reviewed and updated before each major release (version bump, major feature addition).

After each release, hold a retrospective meeting — gather lessons learned, update test suite, improve test coverage, refine metrics.
